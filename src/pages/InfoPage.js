                            Mental health is an amalgamation of emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act as we cope with life. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood and aging.

                        <h3></h3>
                        <ul>
                            <p>There are many different things you can do to improve your mental health, including</p>

                                <b>Staying positive :</b> It’s important to try to have a positive outlook; some ways to do that include finding a balance between positive and negative emotions. Staying positive doesn't mean that you never feel negative emotions, such as sadness or anger. You need to feel them so that you can move through difficult situations. They can help you to respond to a problem. But you don't want those emotions to take over. For example, it's not helpful to keep thinking about bad things that happened in the past or worry too much about the future.

                                <b>Connecting with others :</b> Humans are social creatures, and
                                it's important to have strong, healthy relationships with others.
                                Having good social support may help protect you against the harms
                                of stress. It is also good to have different types of connections.
                                Besides connecting with family and friends, you could find ways to
                                get involved with your community or neighborhood. For example, you
                                could volunteer for a local organization or join a group that is
                                focused on a hobby you enjoy.

                                with stressful situations. They may help you face a problem, take
                                action, be flexible, and not easily give up in solving it.

                                could be through your job, volunteering, learning new skills, or

                                and mental health are connected. Some ways to take care of your
                                physical health include <br />Being physically active. Exercise
                                can reduce feelings of stress and depression and improve your
                                mood.<br />
                                Getting enough sleep. Sleep affects your mood. If you don't get a
                                good sleep, you may become more easily annoyed and angry. Over the
                                long term, a lack of quality sleep can make you more likely to
                                become depressed. So it's important to make sure that you have a
                                regular sleep schedule and get enough quality sleep every night.
